# The container, as far as a process in the privileged Dynamic e2e lane can be one (#332): what the Worker's `docker run`
# of the hosted deployment gives it that a plain process does not have. Called by the `docker` stand-in of the lane
# (fakes/sandbox/bin/docker-worker.sh, E2E_WORKER_WRAPPER) as
#
#   dynamic_e2e_worker_container.sh <the image's entry point> <the entry mode: worker-once or probe>
#
# with the Worker's environment already closed. It must `exec`: the stand-in knows the process by its id.
#
#   - A read-only root, as the hardened container spec has it (`--read-only`): every disk filesystem of a mount
#     namespace of its own is remounted read-only, and the container's writable paths are fresh tmpfs (/tmp here; /run,
#     where the lane's directories for the Worker live, is a tmpfs of the lane already). The Worker's startup self-check
#     (`root_filesystem_writable`) judges exactly this, so a writable root would not advertise `opencode`.
#   - The capabilities of the container: root, with exactly the eight of the spec (`--cap-drop ALL`, then `--cap-add` of
#     them) in the bounding set, no inheritable ones and no-new-privileges. The Worker's startup installs the engine
#     user's network rules and drops NET_ADMIN and SETPCAP itself.
#   - A /tmp that is the container's: the Worker's temporary directories are made there, where the engine user can enter
#     them (the self-check runs `opencode --version` as that user from one). The stand-in points TMPDIR at the Worker's
#     home, a directory only root can enter, which is right for a host process and wrong for a container.
#
# The same arrangement as `probe_as_container` of dynamic_e2e_namespace.sh, which proves the `probe` mode on the lane's
# layout before any journey runs. The list of capabilities is the one of compose.dynamic.yml, kept equal by
# app/src/ci/hosted-dynamic-lane.test.ts.

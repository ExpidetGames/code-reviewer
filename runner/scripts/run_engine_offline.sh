# loopback interface: the operating system itself, not only the Python level guard of the suite,
# guarantees that the real PR-Agent can reach nobody but the fakes. For CI (GitHub's Ubuntu runners
# have passwordless sudo); on a developer machine use `uv run pytest -m engine`.

# The tests run on TEST_MAX_WORKERS pytest-xdist workers (default 4, the cores of a CI runner), one
# file per worker at a time (--dist loadfile: the module-scoped engines of a file are shared by its
# tests). --engine-shard runs one half of the suite (tests/engine_shards.py; CI runs both halves as
# jobs of their own). Options only: the directory tests/engine is always the one that is collected.
#
# The tiktoken cache is filled and the pinned OpenCode is fetched and verified first, outside the
# namespace (the steps that need the internet). The engine also needs a trusted ripgrep on its PATH,
# which the pinned release would otherwise download from GitHub on the first grep.

# The privileged Dynamic e2e lane (#253, #201-T01): the journey of a pull request through the real app,
# the real Dispatcher, the real Worker as root with the capabilities of the hardened container spec and the real
# pinned OpenCode as its engine user, against the loopback fakes. It needs root, nft and a Linux kernel with network namespaces, so it runs in CI (GitHub's Ubuntu
# runners have passwordless sudo) or on a machine where you can sudo. It never skips: what is missing is
# named (app/e2e/helpers/dynamic-preflight.ts) and the run fails.
#
#   scripts/run_dynamic_e2e.sh [playwright arguments, for example --grep @smoke]
#
# Two steps:
#   1. as you, with the internet: the pinned OpenCode and ripgrep (fetch_opencode.py and fetch_ripgrep.py
#      accept only the pinned bytes) and the one production build of the app (`next build`; set
#      E2E_REUSE_BUILD=1 to use the build that is there);
#   2. as root, in `unshare --net --mount --pid --fork --mount-proc`: scripts/dynamic_e2e_namespace.sh. The
#      namespaces hold the lane: loopback is the only network (and a network guard counts and rejects every
#      attempt to leave it), the mounts and the engine user exist only inside, and when the lane ends every
#      process in it ends with it.
# The ports are private: the app listens on E2E_HOSTED_PORT (default 3617) and the Dispatcher on the next one, the
# fakes take random ones. Never 3000 or 3100. The app's database is on the Postgres server E2E_DATABASE_URL names
# (default postgres://postgres:postgres@127.0.0.1:5432/postgres); the lane has no network but loopback, so it reaches
# the server through a Unix socket that app/e2e/pg-bridge.ts forwards from outside the namespace.

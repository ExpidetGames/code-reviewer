"""Shared pytest setup.

The level of a test is decided by its directory (tests/unit, tests/integration, tests/contract,
tests/engine, tests/privileged), so the marker can never drift from where the file lives. A test
outside those directories is a collection error: it would otherwise run unmarked and escape
every level.

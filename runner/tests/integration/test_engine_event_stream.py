"""The engine's event stream on a real loopback socket (#552).

The unit tests give the reader a scripted stream. What they cannot show is what the real response
does: that opening it cannot hang for a turn's length, that a stream which stays open and goes quiet
ends the run, and that closing it from another thread frees the reader. A raw socket server stands
in for the engine and says what the pinned one says (`GET /event` answers with a chunked event
stream whose first event is `server.connected` and which then beats every ten seconds).

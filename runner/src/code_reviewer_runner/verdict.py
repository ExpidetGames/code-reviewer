"""The verdict of the startup self-check: which engines a container may advertise, and why not.

It is the one shape that the `probe` entry mode prints and that the engines file holds (#324). It
carries engines and stable reasons (`SelfCheckReason` values) and nothing else: no path, no
environment, no value of the container. A launcher parses it; a version number lets the shape grow.

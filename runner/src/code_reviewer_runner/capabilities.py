"""The engines a runner may advertise, and the startup self-check that gates them (#195).

A runner advertises an engine in the claim body only after the startup self-check proved the
isolation is effective. The check is simple and fails closed: the engine process must run as the
dedicated unprivileged user, the export mechanism must be read-only for it, and egress must be
proxy-only. A failure never falls back to a host setting, a fork or a weaker mode: the engine is
simply not advertised, and the job loop logs the stable isolation code.

The concrete probes against the container are `dynamic_review/self_check.py` (#202); this module
owns the policy and the result: any failure, expected or not, leaves `opencode` unadvertised.

"""The job host: runs one job to its end and delivers the result (#323).

Everything between "I have a job and the credential to report it" and "the result is delivered or
given up" lives here, so the runner's job loop (which claims) and the Worker (which is handed its
job) run a job in exactly the same way: the job process with the job on its stdin and a minimal
environment, the heartbeats, the hard timeout, the lease check a Dynamic job asks before it writes
its summary, the masking of every log line and every result, the delivery with retry, the orderly
end on shutdown and the sweep of the engine user after a Dynamic job process.

The host never claims and never decides what to do next: it ends in a `JobEnd` and the caller acts
on it (the loop goes on, the Worker exits). The credential of the job is a `ClaimedJob.lease_token`
to the host; in the loop it is the lease token, in the Worker it is the per-job credential. Either
way it only goes out through the `JobApi` and into the masker, never to the job process.

Rules the code below follows (see the CR-29 decisions):

- A job that is refused (unknown command, unsupported platform, invalid input) never starts a
  process: its result carries the stable error code of the refusal.
- The secrets of a job (git token, LLM key, lease token) reach the process through its stdin only,
  and no log line or result the host produces contains them.
- A lost lease (409 on a heartbeat) ends the process and sends nothing more for that job.
- A hard stop (the end of the grace period, or a SIGTERM of a Worker) ends the process and reports
  `runner_shutdown`, which the app gives back to the queue (a repeated report may be answered with
  409, which is fine).

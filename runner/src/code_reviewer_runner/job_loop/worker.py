"""The Worker (#323): runs exactly one job with a per-job credential and then ends.

`code-reviewer-worker --once` reads one document from stdin, `{appUrl, jobId, credential}`, and
nothing else about the job: the job itself is fetched from the app with the credential, run by the
same `JobHost` the runner's loop uses, and its result is delivered with the same credential. The
credential is a secret: it never goes into the arguments, the environment, a file or the log (the
masker knows it from the first line), and the job process never sees it, only the job on stdin.

| Exit | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| 0 | The job succeeded, or it was given back to the queue (a SIGTERM or SIGINT during the job). |
| 1 | The job failed, the app did not hold it any more, or the result could not be delivered. |
| 2 | The Worker could not start the job (`WorkerFailure`, see worker_errors.py). |

A signal during the job ends the process and delivers `runner_shutdown`, which the app takes as a
release. There is no grace period: the platform that stops a Worker does not give one.

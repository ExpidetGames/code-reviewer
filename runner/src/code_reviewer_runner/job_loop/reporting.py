"""Turns what a job process did into the `result` of a `complete` request.

The job process prints one line of JSON (`JobResult`) and exits with 0 or 1. The loop does not
trust it blindly: the line is checked field by field against the contract, the log tail is
redacted again with the secrets of this job and cut to the limit, and a process that did not
produce a usable line (it crashed, was killed, printed nothing) becomes a failure with a stable
code and the end of its stderr. The request must stay under the 64 KiB the app accepts, so the
result is shrunk before it is sent, never after a 413.

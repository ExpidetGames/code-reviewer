"""The reply types of the runner API (`contracts/runner-api.v1.json`) that the Worker and the job
host share.

The claim and the HTTP client of the runner's own job loop are gone (#700): a Dispatcher claims, and
a Worker only fetches, heartbeats and delivers with its per-job credential (`worker_api.py`). What
stays: `ClaimedJob` (a job as the host runs it), the answers to a heartbeat and a completion, and
their parsing. What a caller has to tell apart is small, so the errors (`http.py`) are too:

- `ApiUnavailable`: the app cannot answer now (no connection, 5xx, 429, a wrong token, an answer
  that is not the contract). The caller waits and tries again.
- `LeaseLost`: the app says the runner no longer holds the job (409, or 404). Nothing more may be
  sent for it.
- `ApiRejected`: the app refused this request for good (another 4xx). Retrying the same request
  cannot help.

No error carries a value of the request or the response: they hold secrets.

"""One process per job: start it, bound what it can write, and end it together with its children.

The job goes in on stdin (never in the arguments, never in the environment), the result comes out
as the last line on stdout, diagnostics on stderr. Both streams are read continuously and only the
newest bytes are kept, so a process that writes hundreds of megabytes cannot grow the runner's
memory. The process is the leader of its own process group: ending a job ends the group, so a
helper the process started cannot outlive it.

The group is only ever signalled while its leader is still unreaped (`process_group.py`, #202): a
reaped leader frees its pid, and a later `killpg` could end an unrelated process group that was
given the same number. asyncio's subprocess reaps the child by itself the moment it exits, so the
process is a plain `subprocess.Popen` whose pipes are read through asyncio, and this module decides
when it is reaped (last, after the group is ended; #233).

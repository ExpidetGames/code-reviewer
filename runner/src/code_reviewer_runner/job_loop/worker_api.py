"""The Worker's side of the Worker API (`contracts/worker-api.v1.json`, #323).

Three calls with the per-job credential: the job details (`GET /api/workers/v1/jobs/{id}`), the
heartbeat and the result. The credential is valid for one job only; the Worker holds nothing else
(`Authorization: Bearer <credential>`), and no error carries a value of a request or an answer.

What a caller has to tell apart is the same small set as in the runner API (`api.py`):

- `ApiUnavailable`: the app cannot answer now (no connection, 5xx, 429, an answer that is not the
  contract). The caller waits and tries again.
- `LeaseLost`: the app does not hold the job for this Worker any more (409, 404, and a credential it
  does not accept, which no retry can fix). `CredentialInvalid` and `JobEnded` say which, for the
  log. Nothing more may be sent for the job.
- `ApiRejected`: the app refused this request for good (another 4xx).
- `JobGivenBack`: the app could not mint the git token for the fetch and gave the job back
  (`503 RUNNER_GIT_ACCESS_UNAVAILABLE`): the credential is void and the Worker exits.

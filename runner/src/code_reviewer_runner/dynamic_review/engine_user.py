"""Launching the engine as the dedicated unprivileged user, and ending all that user runs (#197).

The job process is the root supervisor: it prepared the read-only export (#196, `export_isolation`),
runs the model proxy and holds every credential. The engine is a different user in the same
container. This module is the supervisor's side of that boundary:

* the `Popen` options that start a process as that user, with no supplementary groups (a
  `setuid()` in the child, no `sudo`, no setuid helper: `no-new-privileges` stays on);
* the engine's config file, readable by that user and nobody else;
* the proof that the engine's server port is held by the engine and not by a stranger;
* the network rules of that user (`netguard.py`): installed once at container start, with
  `NET_ADMIN` dropped afterwards (`static_isolation.py`); each job checks that the supervisor holds
  neither and proves the rules with a probe before the engine starts;
* the end of the job: everything that user still runs is killed, also what left the process group.

A process group alone is not enough: a helper may `setsid()` and leave it. The dedicated user is
the boundary, so the final step is a `kill(-1, SIGKILL)` run **as that user** (the kernel then
signals exactly the processes that user owns; nobody else can be reached and no pid is looked up and
reused). No capability beyond `SETUID`/`SETGID` is involved for that, and `KILL` lets the supervisor
signal the engine's group.

"""The native path of one Dynamic job (#578, design #544): claim, entry, passthrough proxy, engine.

A job whose claim carries a per-job model entry (`dynamic.modelEntry`, #548) and a cost policy
(`dynamic.cost`, #553) runs here instead of through the legacy proxy. The pieces already exist and
are tested apart; this module is the one place that joins them, so the runner's own flow keeps its
shape:

1. `build_native_job` (before anything is prepared): the target and the upstream from the entry, the
   ledger and the proxy from the policy (`build_native_run`, so the two agree on whose key pays),
   a fresh capability. An upstream address the guard refuses ends the job here, before the engine.
2. `run_native_engine` (inside the preparation): the loopback server on the slot's port, the engine
   configuration of the entry (only the chosen model, the capability, no key, no upstream address),
   `DynamicEngine(plain_final=True, ...)`, and the log line of the finalization.

The real key (`llm.apiKey`) is given to the proxy and to nothing else; the engine is handed the
capability, which is worthless anywhere but at the proxy of this job. Nothing here sets or removes
`cache_control` (caching comes from the engine), steers the model or limits its steps: the cost
limit is the only brake, and the final-call exemption of the ledger makes a run end with a review
rather than with the cost guard's refusal (#542, #552).

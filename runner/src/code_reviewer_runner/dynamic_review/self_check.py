"""The startup self-check that decides whether this runner advertises `opencode` (#202).

It runs once, in the root supervisor, after the one-time network setup (`static_isolation.py`) and
before the job loop claims anything. `opencode` is advertised only when every property holds:

* the process is the root supervisor and an engine user and the slot's ports are configured (only
  the Dynamic runner of `compose.dynamic.yml` has them; the default runner never passes);
* the engine user exists, with its own group, and is not root;
* the static network rules were installed and `NET_ADMIN`/`SETPCAP` are gone from this process;
* the engine binary and `rg` are the pinned files (size and SHA-256 of `opencode-pin.json` and
  `ripgrep-pin.json`), regular files owned by the trusted owner that nobody else can write, and the
  binary reports the pinned version when run as the engine user, offline. The pin files are held to
  the same standard, and so is every directory above each of the four files, up to `/`: a real
  directory (no link), owned by the trusted owner, not writable by group or others (#249);
* a probe run as the engine user reaches the slot's proxy port and nothing else.

Each failure has a stable reason that the loop logs; none carries a value. A successful `--version`
alone proves nothing about isolation, which is why it is only one item of the list. What cannot be
proven at startup is proven per job: the sealed read-only export, unreadable private state and the
probe again before every engine (`supervisor.py`, `engine_user.py`).

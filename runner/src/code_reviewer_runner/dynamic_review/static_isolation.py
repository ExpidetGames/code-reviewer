"""The network setup of the Dynamic runner container, done once at start, and the end of NET_ADMIN.

The engine's nft rules (`netguard.py`) depend on three values only: the engine user and two
loopback ports. With one Dynamic slot those values are fixed for the life of the container, so the
rules are installed once, when the container starts, and the capabilities that installing needed
are then dropped for good (#244, ADR 0003):

* `NET_ADMIN` installs the nftables rules and could change or remove them;
* `SETPCAP` is what allows a process to drop a capability from its bounding set.

`secure_startup` installs the rules, drops both from the bounding set and from the loop's own
permitted, effective and inheritable sets, and reads `/proc/self/status` to confirm it. Everything
the loop starts afterwards (job processes, the engine) inherits the smaller bounding set, so no
process of this container can touch the rules again, root or not. Each Dynamic job re-checks its
own sets (`require_startup_capabilities_gone`) and runs the probe as the engine user, which is the
proof that the static rules are in effect: without `NET_ADMIN` not even the supervisor can list
them.

The one process that keeps the capabilities is PID 1 (`tini`, which runs nothing of the job and is
not reachable by the engine user).

Which rules are installed depends on the kernel (#345): the full `inet` + `reject` ruleset where the
kernel supports it, otherwise an `ip` + `drop` one, with IPv6 switched off by the same startup step
(it needs `NET_ADMIN` too). The choice is the kernel's answer; `secure_startup`'s `detect` seam is
how a test forces the other mode, and nothing in the environment or in a job reaches it.

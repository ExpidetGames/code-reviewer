"""The ledger and the proxy of one native job, made from one policy (#553).

The two must agree on whose key the job runs on: the proxy decides whether an unknown cost ends the
run and the ledger whether it can carry one (and books it by tokens). Built apart they could drift;
built here from the same `CostPolicy` they cannot. This is the one place the wiring of a native job
asks for them.

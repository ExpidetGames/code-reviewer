"""The connection from the supervisor to the provider (#550): https, pinned, no redirect.

`HttpsUpstream` is the only thing that holds the real key's destination. One job has one trusted
base URL (`address.check_base_url`). Every call opens its own connection and:

1. resolves the name and judges **every** address it resolves to (one non-public address refuses the
   name: the connection may pick any of them);
2. connects to an address that was judged, port 443, and never to the name again, so a name that
   changes its answer between the check and the connection cannot redirect the key;
3. speaks TLS to the name (certificate and name verified), and sends the request without following a
   redirect: a 3xx is a status like any other and its `Location` is never read.

Every wait is bounded by the **budget of the call** (`send`'s `timeout`, which the proxy takes as
the smaller of its own limit and the time the job has left): the name lookup (a thread that is
given up on after the budget: `getaddrinfo` has no timeout of its own), each connection attempt
(the budget that is left after the attempts before it, never a fallback), the TLS handshake (what is
left after the connection) and then each read of the answer. A call with no budget makes no
lookup and no connection.

The seam (`Upstream`) is what the proxy sees; tests put a loopback double behind it. The
resolver, the TCP connect, the TLS wrap and the clock are injectable for the same reason, and the
defaults are the real ones.

"""The cost policy of a native job (#553): whose key pays, what prices the ledger uses, and what
bounds a run whose price is not known.

The claim sends it as `dynamic.cost` (`contracts/runner-api.v1.json`, `DynamicCostPolicy`), only to
a runner that advertised the feature `dynamic_cost_policy`, and only for a job that runs through the
passthrough proxy. A job without it is a job of today and nothing here applies to it.

- **Managed key (we pay).** The claim carries the confirmed price book (`app/src/model-prices/`).
  It is the runner's only price source: never the engine's own `cost`, never models.dev. A cost that
  is not known (a call whose usage was not read, one the book cannot price) is `unknown` and ends
  the run with `dynamic_accounting_failed`, which billing treats as our fault. There is no token
  cap: the dollar limit of #540 binds, and the book is complete.
- **Own key (the user pays the provider).** Choosing a model is free, so a price may be missing.
  The book is the catalog's price when there is one, else none. An unknown cost does not end the
  run: it is bound by `maxTotalTokens` and the clock, and the result reports `costUsd: null`, which
  billing charges as minutes only. A call that stated no usage at all still fails the run (the cap
  cannot be applied to it).

The book of a claim is read strictly (`parse_price_book`) and with `strict_cache_read`: a cache read
without a read price is not priced as input (N4 of the review of PR #569). The claim refuses such a
model on the managed key before the job starts; the runner makes the call unpriced if one slips by,
rather than billing a member for a price that nobody confirmed.

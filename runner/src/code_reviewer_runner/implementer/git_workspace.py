"""The git side of an Implementer turn (#762): the safety core of the slice.

What the system does, and what the agent can and cannot:

* The runner (root) clones the base branch, `--depth 1`, into a bare **mirror** only it can enter
  (`/work/mirror.git`). The provider token is in the environment of that one git process and nowhere
  else: not in argv, a config file, a URL, the mirror or anything the agent's user can read.
* The agent works in `/work/repo`, a local clone of the mirror owned by the agent's user. It has no
  remote, no credential, the system identity and a new branch at the base tip.
* A `reference-transaction` hook (installed by the image, #761) keeps the agent on its branch and
  appends every tip update to a spool. It is an accident guard: `git -c core.hooksPath=/dev/null` or
  a hand-written ref gets around it.
* **The guarantee is the push.** From the mirror, as root: fetch the agent's branch into a scratch
  ref, check that the tip is a commit that contains the start commit, descends from what was
  verified before and was committed by the system identity, move the mirror's branch to it only then
  (compare-and-swap) and push without force. A rewrite below what was already pushed ends the turn
  `branch_violation` and the provider keeps the last good tip. Every decision is made from the exit
  status of git and from the objects in the mirror, never from what git printed: the agent decides
  what its side of a fetch prints.
* Root never runs git with the agent's repository as working directory or git directory (it would
  run the `core.fsmonitor`, hooks and aliases the agent can write). `git status` and the leftover
  commit run as the agent's user (through the hook directory of the image, whatever the agent set
  as `core.hooksPath`). The mirror reads the agent's branch through `git upload-pack` that is
  itself run as the agent's user, so the config of the agent's repository is read by the agent's own
  rights and by nothing else.
* A turn whose repository cannot be committed or verified after the agent ran ends with
  `RepositoryUnusable` (wire code `branch_violation`, which the billing table classes as charged):
  the model was used, and what is left is the agent's doing or unknowable.

"""One Implementer turn from the instruction to the result (#764).

The prepared workspace (`git_workspace.py`, #762) and the egress setting (#763) come in; the model
proxy, the engine and the agent's session are started here, and everything is ended here. The flow:

1. The ledger and the passthrough proxy are made from the job's model entry and cost policy, as for
   a native Dynamic job (`native_job.build_native`); the clock of the ledger is the job's time limit
   less the grace kept for the end (`GRACE_SECONDS`).
2. The engine starts as the engine user in `/work/repo`, with the generated configuration and the
   closed environment; the push loop (`PushLoop`) ticks on a thread of its own, so a slow push never
   delays the watch on the limits.
3. The instruction is sent as the one user message. When the turn ends, a working tree that is
   still dirty gets **one** more message in the same session (a fixed text); what is dirty after
   that is committed by the system as the engine user, without a model call.
4. Whatever ended the turn (the agent, the cost limit, the clock, a crash of the engine), the
   engine and everything of its user are ended first, the leftover is committed, and the final push
   is made. The result reports what was committed and pushed, with the stable code of what ended
   the turn.

Nothing steers the agent: the cost limit (the proxy refuses the next call) and the clock are the
only brakes.

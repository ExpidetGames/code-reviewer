"""The engine of one Implementer turn (#764): the pinned OpenCode server, driven over its local
HTTP API, with the write tools.

It has the skeleton of the Dynamic Review's adapter (`dynamic_review/adapter.py`) and reuses its
parts: the engine user and its network rules (`EngineLaunch`), a private home, `opencode serve` on
the slot's loopback port, the HTTP client, the event stream that feeds the tool audit, and the
ledger behind the model proxy. What it does not have is anything review-shaped: no structured
answer, no findings, no wrap-up above the wire. The agent works until it ends its turn; the ledger
refuses the next model call when the cost limit or the clock is reached, and that is what ends it.

Nothing here steers the agent: no step limit, no plan. The cost limit and the clock are the brakes.
Prompt caching is whatever the stock engine and the passthrough proxy do for Dynamic; nothing here
sets, removes or rewrites a cache marker.

"""The loopback CONNECT proxy through which the Implementer agent reaches package registries (#763).

The root supervisor runs one of these for the agent phase. The engine user's nft rules let it open
connections to loopback ports only (the model proxy, the engine's own port and this one,
`netguard.py`), so every tool of the agent (npm, pip, cargo) that honours `HTTPS_PROXY` comes
here, and a tool that ignores the variable has no network at all.

What the proxy does with a connection:

* reads one request head (bounded in size and time) and accepts nothing but `CONNECT host:443`
  with a name on the allowlist (`egress_policy.py`); plain HTTP, other methods, other ports, IP
  literals and user information are refused with a status and no lookup;
* resolves the name itself, judges **every** address it resolves to (loopback, private, link-local,
  metadata and the other special ranges are refused: `passthrough/address.py`) and connects to an
  address it judged, never to the name again, so a name that changes its answer cannot send a
  tunnel somewhere else;
* answers 200 and relays bytes both ways without reading them. A redirect inside the tunnel is the
  client's: its next request is a new CONNECT and meets the same rules.

Limits bound the work an agent can make the supervisor do: open connections (including those
still sending their head), concurrent tunnels, the time for a head, a lookup and a connection, and
the time a tunnel may stay silent. The job log gets one line when the proxy stops: the tunnels per
host, and the refusals per reason with the (sanitised) hosts asked for; never a path, a header, a
byte count or any content.

The resolver and the connector are injectable for tests; the defaults are the real ones. Nothing
here reads the environment or a file: the allowlist and the limits come from the caller.

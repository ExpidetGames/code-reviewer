"""The files that switch the branch guard on for one turn (#762) and the spool the guard writes to.

The hook (`runner/guard/reference-transaction`, installed read-only and root-owned in the image by
#761) reads its configuration from a file: `BRANCH`, `START` and `SPOOL`, sourced by bash. It is
written here, quoted, so that a branch name can never be more than a value. A second file, named by
`GIT_CONFIG_SYSTEM`, is the system git config of the agent's git: the hook directory as
`core.hooksPath` and the repository as `safe.directory`. Both live under /run (the root file system
is read-only) and only root can change them.

The spool is a hint, never evidence: the agent's user appends `<time> <sha>` for every tip update,
and may write anything else. The runner verifies every push anyway, so a forged line costs one
verification.

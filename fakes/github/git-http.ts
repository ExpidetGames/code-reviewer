// The Git part of the fake GitHub: the smart HTTP upload-pack of a repository the test registered, so that
// the runner's own Git transport (`dynamic_review/transport.py`: `GET <repo>.git/info/refs?service=git-upload-pack`
// and `POST <repo>.git/git-upload-pack`, Basic authentication with the user `x-access-token` and an
// installation token) checks a pull request out of a fake, with the unchanged production code. The
// repository is real Git (`git-fixture.ts`) and the protocol is served by the real `git upload-pack`
// (stateless, protocol version 0 like the runner speaks it); only the HTTP framing is done here. The
// authorization of the token is the GitHub App part's (`app-api.ts`).
//
// The push (#766) is the real `git receive-pack` the same way, for the Implementer's branch. A new branch and a
// branch that moves forward are accepted; what GitHub refuses with its default settings is refused too (a history
// that is not a fast-forward of the branch, which also stops `--force`, and the deletion of a branch). The
// repository is a fixture the test made, so a push to its checked out branch is accepted as well and leaves its
// working tree alone. No hook runs. No other service.

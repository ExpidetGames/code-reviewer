# fakes/github

The fake GitHub: one HTTP server that speaks every part of GitHub that Code Reviewer talks to, so the
sign in tests and the GitHub integration tests share one fake and one address. The app is pointed at
it with `GITHUB_OAUTH_BASE_URL` (GitHub's web pages: the authorization and the creation of an App) and
`GITHUB_API_BASE_URL` (both set to the fake's address; they default to the real GitHub). The app refuses both unless `ALLOW_TEST_GITHUB_ENDPOINTS=true` is set as
well, because the client secret, the App JWT and the tokens are sent to that address. State is in
memory. Dummy values only.

| `server.ts`     | The server (`startGithubFake`), the request log, failure injection, the control endpoints.                         |
| `oauth.ts`      | Sign in: OAuth authorize and token endpoints, the user, e-mail and organization membership.                        |
| `manifest.ts`   | The GitHub App manifest flow: the creation page, the one-time code, the conversion.                                |
| `registry.ts`   | The Apps the fake knows (the one registered at start and the ones the manifest flow created), shared by the parts. |
| `app-api.ts`    | The REST API as the GitHub App uses it: installations, tokens, repositories, pull requests.                        |
| `review-api.ts` | What a reviewer reads and writes: diff, commits, file contents and comments of a pull request.                     |
| `webhooks.ts`   | Signed webhook deliveries, `webhookFixture(name)` loads a payload from `../fixtures`.                              |
| `http.ts`       | Small helpers for answering and reading HTTP messages.                                                             |
| `main.ts`       | Starts the sign in part as its own process (Playwright).                                                           |

A part is switched on by its options. `clientId` and `clientSecret` give the sign in; `appId` and
`publicKeyPem` give the GitHub App API (give both options of a part or neither); `manifestFlow: true`
(`GITHUB_FAKE_MANIFEST_FLOW=true`) lets apps be created through the manifest flow and switches the sign in and
the GitHub App API on for them even without a first app. A part that is not
switched on answers 404, and its controls (`addUser`, `addInstallation`, ...) are not there. In the
app's tests `startTestGithub()` (`app/src/test-support/github-fake.ts`) starts it with all three parts.

The app reads `/user/emails` to get the verified primary address (the account permission "Email addresses"): like
GitHub, the endpoint answers for the user token of a GitHub App only when the app holds that permission (the app
registered at start holds it unless a test calls `setAppAccountPermissions({})`), or, for an OAuth app, with the
`user:email` scope. A client id that was created by the manifest flow only accepts the callback addresses of its
manifest as `redirect_uri`, like GitHub.

| `POST /applications/:client_id/token` | "Check a token" with the client credentials as basic authentication: 404 for a token that does not exist when the pair is right, 401 when it is not. This is how the app asks whether a client id and secret belong together. |

## The installation page

`GET /apps/:slug/installations/new?state=` shows one pair of buttons per installation the fake holds ("Install on `<account>`", "Ask `<account>` to approve"; a test adds the installation first, which stands for the account the person chooses). The buttons post to `/apps/:slug/installations/confirm`, which redirects to the App's setup URL with `installation_id`, `setup_action` (`install` or `request`, without an installation id) and the `state`, like GitHub. The setup URL is the one in the manifest of an App created through the manifest flow; for the App registered at start a test says it (`setAppSetupUrl(url)`, `POST /__fake/app-setup-url` `{ url }`). Control endpoints: `POST /__fake/org-members` takes `{ org, login, state?, role? }`, `POST /__fake/org-unreadable` takes `{ org }` (the roles in that organization cannot be read), `POST /__fake/installation-access` takes `{ installationId, login }`, and `POST /__fake/tokens` takes `{ login, scope?, clientId? }` and answers `{ token }`: an access token issued without the browser round trip, which is what an installation that signed people in before accounts holds in its database (the update's organization check uses it; in a Vitest test `github.issueAccessToken(login, { scope, clientId })`). `GET /app` reports the owner with `id` (`ownerIdFor(login)`), which the single-tenant auto-attach compares an installation's account with.

`github.confirmManifest(postUrl, manifest)` does what the person does (posts the form, presses the button) and resolves
to the address the browser is sent back to; `postedManifests()`, `conversionCodes()` and `registeredApps()` read what
happened. Failures are injected like everywhere (`fail({ pathIncludes: "/app-manifests/", status: 404 })`, `delayMs`).

## What a reviewer reads and writes

The calls the GitHub provider of PR-Agent makes (through PyGithub, with the `token` scheme of the
`Authorization` header), so the runner's real PR-Agent can review a pull request here. They need an
installation token with the permission GitHub asks for (`pull_requests`, `issues`, `contents`,
`metadata`) and a repository the token reaches.

Links (`html_url`) point to `https://github.test` unless the fake is started with `selfLinks`
(`GITHUB_FAKE_SELF_LINKS=true` as its own process): then they point to the fake itself, which is what
the runner needs, because it demands that the pull request and the API address of a job are on one
host. Routes that name a commit or a ref (`commits`, `compare`, `contents`) serve the pull request
with that head. A ref that is no head (the default branch, the base commit) is answered only when it
is unambiguous: with one pull request in the repository it is that one's, with several a file is
served when all pull requests that have it agree on its text; everything else is a 404, the fake never
guesses. Not modelled: inline review comments, reviews, labels,
check runs and paging (the engine suite's own fake, `runner/tests/engine/fake_github.py`, has the same
limits and stays: it serves the job entry point on its own, with `/api/v3` in its address).

## In a Vitest test (same process)

```ts
const github = await startGithubFake({
  clientId: "id",
  clientSecret: "secret",
  appId: "424242",
  publicKeyPem, // SPKI PEM; App JWTs are checked against it
  now: clock.now, // optional: the fake's clock for tokens and JWTs
});

// sign in
github.addUser({
  id: 1,
  login: "octocat",
  name: "The Octocat",
  email: null,
  emails: [],
});
// ... point the app at github.baseUrl ...
const callback = await github.authorize(authorizeUrl, "octocat"); // what the "Authorize" button does
github.failTokenEndpoint({ kind: "status", status: 500 }); // or { kind: "delay", delayMs: 5000 }
github.addOrgMember("my-org", "octocat"); // or (…, "pending"); removeOrgMember undoes it
github.failMembershipEndpoint({ kind: "status", status: 503 }); // or a delay; null is normal again
github.revokeToken(github.issuedAccessTokens()[0]); // the token stops working (401)
github.authorize(authorizeUrl, 2002); // a number is the account id: two accounts can share a login
github.holdTokenRequests(2); // the next two token exchanges are answered together (concurrent sign ins)

// GitHub App API
github.addInstallation({
  id: 4242,
  account: { login: "acme", id: 5001, type: "Organization" },
});
github.setRepositories(4242, [{ id: 7001, fullName: "acme/widgets" }]);
github.omitFromListings(4242, [7002]); // a page boundary that skipped a repository (total_count still counts it)
github.rejectAppJwts(true); // every JWT answered with 401
github.setAppPermissions({ metadata: "read", pull_requests: "read" }); // token requests above this get 422
github.answerTokensWith({ repository_selection: "all" }); // a token answer that claims to be broader than asked
github.pullRequestComments("acme/widgets", 7); // the comments below a pull request: id, body, login, htmlUrl, revision
github.addPullRequestComment("acme/widgets", 7, "text"); // written as <slug>[bot] unless a login is given
github.tokenRequests(); // per access token request: repositories, repositoryIds, permissions (null when not sent)
github.revokedInstallationTokens(); // tokens switched off with DELETE /installation/token

// both parts
github.fail({
  pathIncludes: "/installation/repositories",
  status: 503,
  times: 1,
}); // or delayMs, headers; any path except the /__fake/* control endpoints
github.fail({
  pathIncludes: "/app/installations",
  responseDelayMs: 300,
  times: 1,
}); // a slow answer that reflects the state when the request arrived (GitHub App API answers)
github.fail({ pathIncludes: "/pulls/", hang: true }); // never answers; stays open until the client gives up
github.fail({ pathIncludes: "/pulls/", hangBody: true }); // sends the headers and the first byte of the answer, then stalls
github.abortedRequests(); // requests the client closed before an answer was complete (an aborted request, not one merely no longer waited for)
github.requests(); // method and path of every request, no credentials
github.seenCredentials(); // every JWT or token received, to search outputs for leaks
github.reset(); // all state, the request log and the injected failures (not failTokenEndpoint / failMembershipEndpoint)
await github.close();
```

`app/src/test-support/auth-harness.ts` wraps the sign in side together with a real database and the
app's real Better Auth instance. `app/src/test-support/github-app-harness.ts` builds the environment
that points the app's GitHub App settings at the fake. Both start the fake with
`startTestGithub()` unless a test hands them an instance, so a test can use one fake for both.

## Webhooks

`webhooks.ts` signs and builds deliveries like GitHub (`X-Hub-Signature-256`, `X-GitHub-Event`,
`X-GitHub-Delivery`): `webhookDelivery({ event, payload, secret })`. `webhookFixture(name)` loads a
payload from `fakes/fixtures/github-webhooks/<name>.json`: payloads reduced to the fields Code Reviewer
reads, with dummy data, named `<event>.<action>[.<variant>].json`.

## As its own process (Playwright, later the Docker test stack)

```sh
GITHUB_FAKE_CLIENT_ID=id GITHUB_FAKE_CLIENT_SECRET=secret GITHUB_FAKE_PORT=4010 node fakes/github/main.ts
```

`app/playwright.config.ts` starts it next to the app with fixed dummy credentials, including the
public half of the throwaway GitHub App key (`GITHUB_FAKE_APP_ID`, `GITHUB_FAKE_APP_PUBLIC_KEY`; the run enters
the App with its private half in the admin portal of the apps, `e2e/setup/prepare-apps.e2e.ts`) and
`GITHUB_FAKE_MANIFEST_FLOW=true`, so the process serves the sign in, the GitHub App API and the manifest flow. Each journey
adds the accounts and installations it needs (`app/e2e/helpers/github-fake.ts`: `POST /__fake/users`,
`POST /__fake/installations` with `{ installation, repositories }`) and never resets the fake, because
other spec files run at the same time.

## Not covered yet

Inline review comments and reviews, and delivering webhooks over HTTP to a running app (the
journeys sign and send them themselves, `app/e2e/helpers/webhooks.ts`).

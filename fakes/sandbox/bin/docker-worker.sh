# A stand-in for the `docker` executable for the hosted end-to-end journeys (#332): it takes the `docker run` the
# Sandbox-Launcher renders (the real flags of the hardened container spec, the image id, the entry mode) and runs the
# REAL Worker for it as a local process, where a daemon would have run the container. Nothing of the Worker is
# replaced; what is not there is the container itself (no namespaces, no limits, no capabilities), which the
# privileged lane adds with E2E_WORKER_WRAPPER and `sandbox-local` proves with a real daemon.
#
#   E2E_DOCKER_DIR            where the records go (required); never inside the "VM" directory
#   E2E_IMAGE_ID              what `docker image inspect --format {{.Id}}` prints (required)
#   E2E_WORKER_COMMAND        the program of the image's entry point, `code-reviewer-runner` (required)
#   E2E_WORKER_WRAPPER        optional: a program that runs the entry point in the way of the container, called as
#                             `wrapper <program> <mode>`, and that must `exec` the program (the privileged lane's
#                             read-only root and capabilities)
#   E2E_WORKER_PASS_<NAME>    given to the Worker as `<NAME>`, for what the image carries itself (the fake LLM's job
#                             command, the tiktoken cache)
#   E2E_WORKER_ONCE_UNSET     optional: names (space separated) taken out of the environment of `worker-once` only. The
#                             container is root with capabilities and its Worker starts with the Dynamic startup (the
#                             network rules, the end of NET_ADMIN) when `RUNNER_DIFF_JOB_USER` is set; a host process
#                             without root cannot, so a lane that is not privileged unsets it and serves Diff jobs. The
#                             `probe` mode keeps it: its verdict is the answer of an environment that cannot do that.
#   E2E_WORKER_GATE           optional path: the Worker is not started while a file exists there
#   E2E_WORKER_PATH           the PATH of the Worker (default: the PATH of this process)
#
# The Worker's environment is closed, like a container's: the `--env` flags of the rendered command, the
# E2E_WORKER_PASS_ variables, and a PATH, a HOME and a TMPDIR of its own. Nothing else of this process reaches it, so a
# secret of the Dispatcher's or the test's environment cannot. The start document comes on stdin as it does into the
# container. `docker rm --force <name>` ends the Worker's whole tree, which is what the end of a container does.
#
# Records: run-<n>.args (one argument per line), run-<n>.env (the Worker's environment, names and values),
# run-<n>.pid (the Worker's process id) and run-<n>.log (what the Worker wrote to stderr, and to
# stdout unless the mode is `probe`, whose stdout is the verdict) for each `docker run`; commands.log for every other
# command. An argument this script does not know is refused with 125, like a daemon refuses one it does not know:
# a new flag of the spec is a decision, not something to ignore.

# Smoke test of the Worker image, the `sandbox` target of runner/Dockerfile and the only image of the project: the
# golden snapshot of the hosted deployment builds it and every review job runs it in a Vercel Sandbox VM.
# Usage: docker/smoke/runner.sh [<image>]   (default: code-reviewer-runner-sandbox:local)
#
# It proves that the image starts, runs unprivileged, can write to its temporary directory and holds nothing that
# must stay out of an image; that the pinned PR-Agent is installed and works offline (the version equals the pin, its
# tiktoken encodings are baked in, and a job run through the real PR-Agent with no network at all ends in a well
# formed failure result without a secret in it); that the engine is the pinned one, runs as its own user, and that
# the startup self-check advertises `opencode` exactly when it should (#202). The entry modes are proven with the
# flags of the hardened container spec (#324): `probe` prints a JSON verdict, `worker-once` runs one job against the
# fake App (Node) and `worker-reap` is on the PATH; the image carries no Dispatcher bundle. The toolchain of the
# Implementer's agent (#761) is proven here too: git 2.53 or newer, Node.js, pnpm, Python, uv, a compiler, jq and
# unzip at the pinned versions, the guard hook root-owned with no hooksPath baked in, the guard matrix passing as
# the engine user in the production layout, and the size of the image against the budget of the shared image.

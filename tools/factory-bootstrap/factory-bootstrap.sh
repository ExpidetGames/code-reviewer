# Bootstrap of the second App ("factory", #732): lists every Infisical entry and Vercel setting the factory lane needs
# and, only when the owner asks with --out, generates the random secrets of the clone into a new file that only the
# owner can read (mode 0600).
#
#   factory-bootstrap.sh                  prints the entries and the Vercel checklist; generates nothing, writes nothing
#   factory-bootstrap.sh --out <file>     also generates the five secrets into <file> (NAME=value lines)
#
# A secret is never printed, never put on a command line and never traced: it lives in shell variables, goes to the
# file through the built-in printf, and the script switches `set -x` off first thing. The script reads no file (no
# .env*, nothing) and takes no value from the environment. It refuses an existing file, a file called .env*, and a
# path in a git checkout. Delete the file once the values are in Infisical.

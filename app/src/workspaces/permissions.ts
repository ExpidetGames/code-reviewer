// What each role may do in a workspace (docs/decisions/0001-editions-setup-and-accounts.md, section 2.6).
// The one matrix of the app, as pure functions: every route, page and service asks here, and the table in
// permissions.test.ts pins every action against every role, so a change of the matrix is a change of a
// test. The principle is that every action needs the lowest role that is safe.
//
// - Member: uses the workspace. Sees projects, runs, settings and the members, starts reviews and changes
//   the settings of a project.
// - Admin: everything a Member can, plus what the workspace is made of: connections, repositories (which
//   projects are switched on), the review defaults and the LLM key, and Members and their invitations
//   (invite, remove, revoke; Members only).
// - Owner: everything an Admin can, plus Admins and Owners (invite, change roles, remove) and renaming the
//   workspace.
//
// Two rules sit outside the matrix because they depend on more than the role of the person who acts: the
// last Owner cannot leave, be removed or be demoted (src/workspaces/members.ts), and a person cannot act on
// a workspace they are not a member of at all (src/workspaces/access.ts).

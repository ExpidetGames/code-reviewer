// How a run's end bills (ADR 0006, 2.6 and D7): a pure mapping from the end state of a job and its stable codes to one of
// three classes. Every terminal code of today is in a table, and a test fails when a code appears that has no class
// (`outcome.test.ts`: the job end codes, the error codes and checkout reasons of the runner contract, the release
// reasons, the reasons of a runner's loop and the settled reasons). The split follows the maintainer's decision of
// 2026-10-19 (#489, #523): a run is free only when the failure is clearly our fault, and charged in full otherwise. The
// minutes-only class is left for a run whose AI cost is unknown. No database, no clock.

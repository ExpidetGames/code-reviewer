// The handler behind `POST /api/webhooks/github-app`. It is a function of its collaborators, so the
// route file only wires the real ones in (`shared.ts`) and tests wire fakes in.
//
// The order is the contract; each step ends the request on failure, and nothing before the claim of
// the delivery id has a side effect:
//
//   1. size      the body is read with a 1 MB limit                               413
//   2. signature `verifyWebhook(null, request)`: HMAC of the exact bytes           401
//   3. shape     the event and delivery headers exist, the body is JSON            400
//   4. relevance an event the app does not use is answered at once                 202
//   5. claim     the delivery id is claimed; a succeeded id is a duplicate         202
//                an id another request is handling right now                        409
//   6. identify  `identifyWebhook` names the installation; the integration is loaded, and with it
//                the workspace the delivery belongs to (everything after this runs in that
//                workspace: its projects, its settings, its job queue)
//   7. translate `parseEvent`: a review trigger, an installation change or "ignored"
//   8. act       trigger -> the repository must have an active project, then the trigger
//                policy (automatic-review-policy.ts: drafts, settings, the debounce of a push;
//                then the commit still being the head, checked against GitHub, failing open) or,
//                for a comment command, the project's list of allowed commands; then
//                `canTrigger`, then the intake;
//                closed pull request -> its waiting jobs are dropped;
//                change -> the shared sync; an unusable payload                     202, 400
//
// Only a delivery that succeeded (a trigger handed over, an installation synchronized) stays a
// duplicate; one that was turned away or failed can be redelivered with the same id. A failure after
// the claim releases it and answers with a 5xx. The answer is sent when the work is done: the work is small (a few
// GitHub calls at most, each with a 15 second timeout), and a failure has to reach GitHub as a status
// code, which `after()` could not do.

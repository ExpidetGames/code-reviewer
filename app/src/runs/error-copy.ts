// from three places: the queue (`JOB_ERROR_CODES`), the claim of the runner API (`CLAIM_FAILURE_CODES`
// and `CLAIM_RELEASE_REASONS`) and the runner itself (`RUNNER_ERROR_CODES`). A test requires a text
// for every code of those lists, so a new code cannot ship without one. A code nobody knows (a newer
// runner, a changed database) gets a general sentence and is shown as it is, never as a crash.
//
// Nothing here repeats what a runner or a pull request wrote: the texts are fixed, and the code is
// shown only when it has the plain shape of a code.
//
// The texts that name the product (#740) are made from the identity the caller hands in, so the same words serve every
// product; `errorCopy(product)` is the table, `describeErrorCode(product, ...)` the sentence.

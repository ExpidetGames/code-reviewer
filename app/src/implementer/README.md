# Implementer: service and routes behind the form (#755)

Part of the Implementer of the factory deployment (epic #745, `plans/implementer-slice.md`). This folder is the server side of
"send off a task": which repositories, branches and models a person can pick, and the validated submit that writes a session, a
turn and a queued job. The page that uses it is `/w/<slug>/implementer` (#756, below). It follows the pattern of `manual-reviews`.

The routes exist only in a deployment with the capability `implementer` (the product `factory`, switched on by
`PRODUCT_CAPABILITIES`). Everywhere else every route below is **absent**: the access proxy answers it as a path that does not
exist (`src/capabilities/routes.ts`, class `implementer`, one entry per route file; `routes.test.ts` fails for a route without one),
and each route file asks again (`requireImplementerCapability()` in `shared.ts`, Next.js's own `notFound()`) before the session
or the database is looked at, so code-review.com hands out nothing.

## Routes

All four are for every member (`start_implementer_task`, minimum role `member`; one line in `workspaces/permissions.ts` raises
it), run through `withWorkspace(...)` after the proxy, and answer `Cache-Control: no-store`. Every request is checked for where it
comes from (`Sec-Fetch-Site` / `Origin`), the body of the POST for `application/json` and 64 KB. Every refusal is `{ "error": <code> }`.

- `GET /api/w/:workspace/implementer/repositories`: `{ repositories: [{ id, fullName, writeGranted }] }`, the active
  repositories of the workspace whose integration is active (a project is not needed), by name. `writeGranted` is what the
  installation has accepted (`IntegrationProvider.installationPermissions`, asked once per installation); an installation the
  platform has removed or refuses reads as `false`, any other failure is `503`.
- `GET /api/w/:workspace/implementer/repositories/:repositoryId/branches`: `{ defaultBranch, branches, truncated }`, the default
  branch first, at most 100 names (`getRepositoryFacts` and `listBranches`).
- `GET /api/w/:workspace/implementer/models`: the options of the picker (below).
- `POST /api/w/:workspace/implementer/tasks` with `{ repositoryId, baseBranch, branch, instruction, model, costLimitCents?,
clientRequestId }`: `201 { runId, sessionId }`, `200` with the same ids for a client request id that was accepted before (nothing
  is written then). `model` is `{ entryId }` (operator's key) or `{ provider, model }` (own key).

| 400       | `IMPLEMENTER_REQUEST_INVALID` (+ `issues`)                            | The body or the repository id is not usable; an issue is `{ field, code }`, a branch names the rule it breaks      |

| 404       | `IMPLEMENTER_BASE_BRANCH_NOT_FOUND`                                   | The repository has no branch with the base branch's name                                                           |
| 409       | `IMPLEMENTER_APP_NOT_INSTALLED`                                       | The integration is disabled, or GitHub answers 401, 403 or 404 for the installation or the repository              |
| 409       | `IMPLEMENTER_WRITE_NOT_GRANTED`                                       | The installation has not accepted contents write (#749); nothing else is asked of GitHub                           |
| 409       | `IMPLEMENTER_BRANCH_CONFLICT`                                         | The new name is a folder of a listed branch or the other way round (`foo`, `foo/bar`): a new branch name is needed |
| 409       | `IMPLEMENTER_BRANCH_EXISTS`                                           | The new branch exists on GitHub, or a session of the repository holds the name: **a new branch name is needed**    |
| 413 / 415 | `IMPLEMENTER_BODY_TOO_LARGE` / `IMPLEMENTER_CONTENT_TYPE_UNSUPPORTED` | A body over 64 KB; a body that is not `application/json`                                                           |
| 422       | `IMPLEMENTER_MODEL_NOT_ALLOWED` (+ `reason`)                          | The model is not one the claim would run (reasons in `errors.ts`)                                                  |
| 422       | `EXCEEDS_OPERATOR_MAXIMUM` (+ `maximumCents`)                         | The cost limit is above the operator's maximum per turn                                                            |
| 503       | `IMPLEMENTER_GITHUB_UNAVAILABLE`                                      | GitHub failed, timed out, was rate limited or answered with something unusable; nothing was written                |

A request without a session is answered `401` and one from a person outside the workspace `404 not_found` by `withWorkspace`,
before any of this runs.

## The submit

In this order, each step ends the request on failure, and **nothing is written before the last one**:

0. **a request that was accepted before is answered first** (`queue.findImplementerTurn`, by the job's `delivery_id`
   `implementer:<workspace id>:<client request id>`): `200` with the ids of that task, nothing asked of GitHub, nothing written.
   A reconnect or a retry minutes later, after the agent has pushed the branch, gets the first task back and not "the branch
   exists", so nobody starts a second, paid task by choosing a new name;
1. the body is valid (`start-input.ts`; the new branch by `branch-name.ts`, which refuses a name equal to the base branch);
2. the repository is this workspace's (`repositories` is created for the workspace, every read filters by it), active, and its
   integration is active;
3. the installation holds `contents: write` (`installationPermissions`);
4. `getRepositoryFacts` — **always before `getBranch`**: `getBranch` answers `null` for a repository path that went stale, so a
   `null` is believed only after the path resolved;
5. `getBranch(base)` must exist (its sha becomes the job's `head_sha`), `getBranch(new)` must not, and the new name must not be
   a folder of a listed branch or the other way round (`foo` and `foo/bar`; `IMPLEMENTER_BRANCH_CONFLICT`, from
   `listBranches`). **What this cannot see:** a conflicting branch beyond the first 100 the platform lists, and the name of a
   task whose branch is not on GitHub yet. Git finds those at the push (`push_rejected`);
6. the model is allowed (`models.check`, the rule of the picker);
7. a cost limit is at most the operator's maximum (`review_max_cost_cents`); none asked for is stored as none, and the maximum
   applies at the claim;
8. `queue.enqueueImplementerTurn`: session, turn and job in one transaction, then the Dispatcher is woken as for any job. A lost
   race on the branch name hits the unique index of the sessions and is `IMPLEMENTER_BRANCH_EXISTS`; two submits with one new
   branch give exactly one `201`.

A turn that fails before it starts keeps its branch name (accepted for this slice, #785), so the retry with the same name and a
new request id is `IMPLEMENTER_BRANCH_EXISTS`; the message says a new branch name is needed, and the form shows it.

The branch name is checked against git's rules at submit: at most 200 characters, **each part between slashes at most 240 UTF-8
bytes** (a file name holds 255 bytes and git also makes `<name>.lock`; `ä` is two bytes, so 150 times `ä` is under 200
characters and cannot be created), no white space of any kind (`\s`, the class of the queue's `BRANCH_NAME`: NBSP, U+2028,
U+FEFF too, so a name the form accepts is never refused by the queue without an issue), and git's own rules. The branch in the
job's `pr_url` is percent-encoded part by part (`#`, `%` and `+` stay in the path); `?`, `..` and the other characters git
refuses never get that far. An id with a NUL byte (in the body or as `%00` in the address) is an unknown id (`404`), not a
database error; a model name with a control character is refused as invalid.

## The models

One rule serves the picker (`models.options()`) and the submit (`models.check()`), and it is the claim's (#753): the agent is
OpenCode, so the native path is mandatory (an entry from the catalog and a cost policy). The key mode of the workspace decides:

- **own key**: the providers of the models.dev catalog (`src/native-providers/`) for which the workspace has saved a readable
  key, and the models the catalog lists. The registry's two providers (Anthropic, OpenRouter) are not on the native path and are
  not offered. Reasons: `provider_unsupported`, `no_key`, `model_not_in_catalog`.
- **operator's key**: the released catalog entries that serve Dynamic Review, that the plan allows (`modelAccess`) and whose model
  has a confirmed price and a catalog entry (`nativeCost.policyFor("managed")` and `entryFor`). A member sees the fields of
  `MemberCatalogEntry` only: never the provider or the model id (principle 2 of epic #420). Reasons: `entry_unknown`,
  `entry_not_released`, `entry_kind_mismatch`, `entry_not_allowed`, `entry_unavailable`.
- the other form of choice for the key mode is `wrong_key_mode`; entitlements that cannot be read give `key_mode_unreadable` and an
  empty picker.

## Tests

Unit: `branch-name.test.ts` (more than 30 names, a subset cross-checked against the real `git check-ref-format`, and every accepted name created with a real `git checkout -b`), `start-input.test.ts`,
`models.test.ts`, `absent-routes.test.ts` (the proxy marks every route missing without the capability). Integration:
`service.integration.test.ts` (real Postgres, the real GitHub App provider and client against the fake GitHub, the real queue),
`http.integration.test.ts` (the handlers), `integration-tests/http/implementer-route-files.integration.test.ts` (the real route
files with the running server's wiring, also in the deployments without the capability). Byte-for-byte equality of the 404 with a
path that does not exist runs in the hosted lane (`e2e/hosted/capabilities.e2e.ts`).

## The page (#756)

`src/app/(app)/w/[workspace]/implementer/page.tsx` and `ui/`. The page is in the sidebar between the QA area and Runs (`shell/nav-items.ts`,
capability `implementer`) and, like the routes, is **absent** outside the capability: `routes.ts` classifies it `implementer`, the proxy answers
it as a path that does not exist, and the page asks again (`requireImplementerCapability()`) before it looks at the session. The server hands
the form the workspace and the operator's maximum cost per task and nothing else; the form loads the repositories, branches and models through
the routes above, so the page reads no secret and no token.

| File                      | Role                                                                                                                                                                               |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ui/implementer-form.tsx` | The form: repository, base branch (the default one preselected and marked), new branch, task (20,000 characters, counter), model, optional cost limit; the submit and its refusals |
| `ui/model-picker.tsx`     | The model picker with the select of the settings form: provider then model on the own key, one entry (by the operator's name) on the operator's key, the empty states              |
| `ui/api.ts`               | The four calls to the routes (`requestJson`), with a stand-in for tests                                                                                                            |
| `ui/messages.ts`          | A sentence for every stable code (`IMPLEMENTER_ERROR_CODES`), every rule of the branch name and every refusal reason of a model; `messages.test.ts` fails for a missing one        |
| `ui/cost-limit.ts`        | Dollars as typed to whole cents, refused above the operator's maximum before anything is sent                                                                                      |
| `ui/branch-suggestion.ts` | `implementer/` and six random lowercase letters or digits, made in the browser (a prerendered name would be the same for everybody)                                                |
| `ui/use-request.ts`       | Loads one thing from a route; an answer for another repository than the one shown is dropped                                                                                       |

- **A repository without write permission** is listed, disabled, with the note "approve the new GitHub permission". If **no** repository has write
  permission the form says so plainly (an owner of the GitHub account or organisation approves the new permission on GitHub, then reload) and
  cannot be sent. Without a linked repository the page links to Connections; without a model it links to the LLM access settings.
- **The branch name** is checked as the server checks it (`checkBranchName`, `validateStartInput`): on leaving the field and at the submit, with one
  sentence per rule. `IMPLEMENTER_BRANCH_EXISTS` and `IMPLEMENTER_BRANCH_CONFLICT` mark the field and say that **a new branch name is needed**.
- **A retried submit starts one task.** The client request id is made once per load of the form, at the first send, and every later send of
  that form (after `503`, a lost answer or an edit) carries the same id; the server answers `200` with the first task's ids. The button is
  disabled while the request is pending, and a second Enter is ignored. Any success (`201` or `200`) goes to `/w/<slug>/runs/<runId>`.
- No text from GitHub or from a response is shown: every refusal is a fixed sentence for its code, and a code the page does not know gets the
  generic sentence.

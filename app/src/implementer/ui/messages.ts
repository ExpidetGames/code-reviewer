// The copy of the Implementer page (#756). The routes answer with stable codes; this is where a code becomes a sentence (the UI
// translates codes, never the other way round). Nothing a response carried (a message, a name, a raw answer of GitHub) is ever put
// into a sentence: the sentences are fixed, and the one number an answer carries (the operator's maximum) is formatted here. A
// code this file does not know gets the generic sentence. `messages.test.ts` fails for a code without a sentence of its own.

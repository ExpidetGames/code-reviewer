// Keeps a page's data fresh without a reload: the server renders the first snapshot, the browser asks
// for newer ones while something can still change. Three rules make it safe with Cache Components,
// which keeps a page that was left mounted (hidden) instead of dropping it:
//
// - The snapshot the server rendered is the truth; a snapshot fetched later is shown only while the
//   server's one is the same object it was fetched next to. When the page is rendered again with new
//   data (a filter, `router.refresh()`), the new server data wins and the fetched one is dropped.
// - Polling lives in an effect, and a hidden page runs the cleanup: it stops while the page is not
//   shown and starts again (with one request at once) when it is shown.
// - A failed request keeps the last data on screen and sets `failed`; the next attempt runs on the
//   normal schedule, and the wait doubles with every further failure in a row (up to a minute), so a
//   server that is down is not hammered. A failure that cannot get better by asking again (the
//   session ended, the person is not allowed, the thing is gone) stops polling for good: `stopped`.

// Changing the tenancy of the instance (docs/decisions/0001-editions-setup-and-accounts.md, section
// 2.3):
//
// - single to multi is always allowed; the workspace and its members stay as they are;
// - multi to single is allowed only while at most one workspace exists (a deleted one, #658, is not one). With none, the default
//   workspace is created and the acting admin becomes its Owner; with one, it stays as it is. With
//   more, the change is refused with the number of workspaces and nothing changes.
//
// The count, the workspace and the setting are one transaction, and a user creates a workspace in a
// transaction that reads the tenancy (src/workspaces/create-workspace.ts). On SQLite every
// transaction takes the write lock when it begins (`begin immediate`, set in src/db/dialect.ts), so the two cannot interleave: whichever comes
// first decides, and the other sees its result. An instance can therefore never end up
// single-tenant with two workspaces. (A database without that lock needs a row lock on the tenancy
// setting here and there; the Postgres port is a later issue.)

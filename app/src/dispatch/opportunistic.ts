// The sweep's repair work, done by the requests that already touch the database (#395). The cron sweep runs
// every two hours only; a webhook delivery, a Worker's heartbeat or its result is a moment at which the database
// is awake anyway, so these requests (after their response) release the leases that ran out and send what is due:
// a Worker that vanished is noticed when the next request arrives, not two hours later.
//
// Cheap by construction: at most once per interval per process, and under a lock of its own (`OPPORTUNISTIC_LOCK`),
// not the sweep's: the cron runs every two hours and is not repeated by the platform, so a run of this work that held
// the sweep's lock at that moment would make the whole sweep a no-op. Everything it does is also done by the sweep;
// both are safe to repeat, and every send is fenced in its row.

// The dispatch webhook as a service (#326): wakes the Dispatcher for a job that was queued, and keeps the
// state of that call in `job_dispatches` so a call that failed is made again.
//
// - `onEnqueued(result)` is the hook of `createJobQueue`: it runs after the enqueue transaction committed
//   (in `after()` in the app, src/dispatch/shared.ts), never throws and never delays the enqueue.
// - `sendDue(limit)` is the hook of the cron sweep (#328): it sends every queued job that is due and has no
//   call yet, or whose call is due again (back-off over, acknowledgement timeout over, a job given back).
//   Nothing here schedules itself: no timer, no loop. A serverless instance lives for seconds.
// - `sendWaiting(...)` and `redispatch(jobId)` (#395) are what runs when a job ends: the jobs that were told "not
//   now" (the pool cap, the running job of their pull request) are sent as soon as a slot frees, and a job that was
//   given back after a failed launch is sent again at once. The normal flow never waits for the sweep.
//
// A send is claimed in the row first (`claimSend`, a compare and set on `next_dispatch_at`), so the request
// that queued the job, the sweep and another instance never send the same call twice. The job itself is
// durable before any of this starts: nothing here can lose it.

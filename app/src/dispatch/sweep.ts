// One run of the cron sweep of a hosted deployment (#328). In a serverless deployment nothing polls and no
// process lives long enough to hold a timer, so the clock is this run, called once a minute by the platform's
// cron (src/cron/dispatch-sweep.ts, which also makes sure two runs never overlap). Per run, in this order:
//
//  1. `expire`: lapsed leases put back in the queue (or failed on the last attempt), jobs past the hard limit
//     failed with `timeout`: what a claim does first, for a deployment in which nobody claims often.
//  2. `give_up`: a job that has waited for a claim longer than the give-up time fails with
//     `dispatch_unavailable`, so a queued review never waits for ever when the Dispatcher is gone. Off in poll
//     mode unless the operator sets `RUNNER_DISPATCH_GIVE_UP_SECONDS` (settings.ts).
//  3. `revive`: a dispatch that the Dispatcher stopped (`not_capable`) is looked at again after
//     `STOPPED_REVIVE_MS`: the Dispatcher may have been updated or its engines may be back.
//  4. `send`: the jobs that are due and not yet called, or whose call is due again, within the pool cap
//     (`RUNNER_DISPATCH_MAX_RUNNING`): at most as many as there are free slots.
//  5. `notices`: the notices of refused reviews whose post failed and whose wait is over (#281), at most one
//     batch, each tried a few times at most.
//  6. `checks`: the check runs and review verdicts of jobs whose GitHub state is behind (#405): jobs the steps above
//     ended or requeued, jobs no request named, syncs whose retry is due. At most one batch, within a time budget.
//  7. `cleanup`: the hourly cleanup a long-lived server runs on a timer, once when the hour has changed.
//  8. `billing_holds`: while billing is on, releases the holds of jobs that ended while it was off (#591), once more than the
//     switch-on did. A job that ended in the moment billing was switched on is not seen by the switch-on; this finds it.
//  9. `balance_mails`: mails the balance crossings that are due (#506): a settlement of this sweep (an expired lease, a stranded
//     hold) or of a superseded job has no response to send after, so the mail would wait for the next claim or webhook. While
//     billing is off it reads the switch and does nothing. It never throws; a step that fails is named like any other.
// 10. `journal_check`: while billing is on, the daily check of the billing journal (#626): `verify()` of every workspace's journal, a
//     bounded step of the pass per run (src/billing/journal-check.ts). The result is kept in an instance setting, which the admin
//     billing page shows, and an inconsistency is logged by a stable code. Once a day it does real work; in the other runs it reads one
//     instance setting, and while billing is off nothing but the switch.
// 11. `models_dev`: the daily fetch of the models.dev catalog (#548), when the last one is more than a day old. Last, so
//     that a slow answer from the internet never delays the steps that move jobs. A fetch that fails records its own
//     failure (`models_dev_fetch_state`) and is not a failed step; a step fails only when the fetch itself threw.
//
// A step that fails is logged by its name and does not stop the others; the next run tries again. Nothing a
// database or an answer said is ever logged: a connection string can be in it.

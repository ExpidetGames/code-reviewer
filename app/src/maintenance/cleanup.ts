// Removes rows nobody needs any more, so tables that an outsider can make grow stay small: the counters of
// `rate_limits` (one per address, link or account that was ever counted), the verification links and the
// reset links that expired or were used. Nothing that still has an effect is removed.
//
// - A counter is removed once its window is over, and every window of the app is at most 24 hours
//   (`LONGEST_RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW_MS`, pinned by the test against every window constant), so no counter in
//   force is ever removed and no limit starts early.
// - A signed state (the single-use side of the round trips through GitHub) is removed once it has expired.
// - A sign-up that was never verified is removed a week after its first verification link was made (and at
//   the earliest a week after the sign-up; more links do not postpone it), together with its password account, its links and its reset
//   links (they cascade). Only a plain pending sign-up qualifies: see `expireUnverifiedAccounts`.
// - A verification link is kept for a week after it expired or was used, so that someone who holds it
//   (and its password) is told "used" or "expired" and not just "not valid". After that it is gone.
// - The LLM key that was handed to a runner with the claim of a job (`job_claimed_keys`, encrypted) is kept
//   for a week after the job finished, as long as a late or repeated report of the job can still need it to
//   mask the key in its result. After that it is gone: a key that was rotated away does not stay in the
//   database for ever. (The row also goes with its job.)
// - The row of the dispatch webhook of a job (`job_dispatches`, #326) is kept for a week after the job
//   finished, for whoever asks why a review started late, and then removed. A queued or running job keeps its row.
// - A handoff token of "Manage plan" (`plan_handoff_tokens`, #284) is valid for five minutes; its row is kept a day
//   after it expired, then removed (not counted in the result, like a signed state).

// POST /api/runners/v1/claim: hands the next job to a runner, with everything it needs to run it.
//
// The credentials are created here, at claim time, and nowhere else (never when the job is queued):
// the job is claimed first (so it has a holder and a lease), then, in this order,
//
//   1. the claim guard may refuse it (the project is off, see claim-guard.ts),
//   2. the provider, model and (on the operator's key) catalog entry are chosen (`selectModel`, claim-selection.ts), and
//      only then the key of that provider is loaded (`keyFor`): the key follows the selection, never the other way round,
//   3. the pull request must still exist and be open (`getPullRequest`),
//   4. the git credentials are created for exactly this repository (`jobAccess`, the only call that
//      mints a token for a job) and revealed once, into the response.
//
// A job that cannot run for a reason that will not go away ends as failed with a stable code, and
// the runner is handed the next job (it never hears of it). A reason that may pass (GitHub is down or
// rate limiting, the pull request could not be read) gives the job back with `release` (a lost
// attempt, capped like a lapsed lease) and answers 503 with Retry-After.
//
// Nothing in here logs or keeps a credential: the revealed access exists only as a local value that
// is built as late as possible and dropped with the response.
//
// #320: a claim that names the feature `worker_credential` (a Dispatcher) runs steps 1 to 3 only and
// answers with a per-job credential and no input. Step 4 (`buildJobInput`: the job's input, with the git
// credentials and the model key) runs when the Worker fetches the job (`worker-fetch.ts`), by the same
// code, so the Dispatcher never sees a secret of the job.

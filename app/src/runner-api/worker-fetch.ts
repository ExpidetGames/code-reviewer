// GET /api/workers/v1/jobs/:id (#320): the Worker fetches its job. This is where the secrets of a split
// claim are created: the same checks and the same step 4 as the legacy claim (`checkJob`, then
// `buildJobInput` in claim.ts), only now for the Worker that holds the credential, so a Dispatcher never
// sees the git token or the model key.
//
//   - at most `MAX_WORKER_FETCHES` per claim (counted before anything is created); each fetch mints a
//     fresh installation token;
//   - the model key is remembered (`job_claimed_keys`) before it leaves, so a result is masked even after
//     the key was rotated, whichever app instance serves it;
//   - a permanent failure ends the job with its stable code and answers 409 RUNNER_JOB_ENDED; a failure
//     that may pass gives the job back (an attempt is counted) and answers 503 with Retry-After; anything
//     unexpected gives the job back and answers 500.

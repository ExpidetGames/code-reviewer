// Remembers which LLM keys were handed to the runner with the claim of a job. The key can be rotated while a job
// runs, and the runner's log may then hold the old key: to mask it in the result the app needs the key of the
// claim as well as the current one. A job can be handed a key more than once (a claim again after a lost lease, the
// fetches of a Worker, #276), and the operator's key can be rotated in between, so **every key handed out for the job
// is kept**, up to `CLAIMED_KEYS_PER_JOB` (the fetch budget of a claim); past that the oldest is forgotten. A key
// that is already remembered takes no new place.
//
// The key is kept in the DATABASE, encrypted like every secret (AES-256-GCM, a key derived from `APP_SECRET`,
// the table, the id of the job and the field bound into the ciphertext; the sealed text is the JSON list of the keys,
// and a row of the earlier format, one plain key, is still read), so any app instance can mask a result,
// not only the one that handed the key out (docs/decisions/0001-editions-setup-and-accounts.md, section 2.10).
// The row goes with its job, and the cleanup removes the rows of jobs that finished long ago
// (src/maintenance/cleanup.ts). A key is not forgotten when its job completes: a repeated completion is compared
// on the stored form and must be masked the same way.
//
// #280: next to the keys it remembers the **models** a job was handed on the operator's managed tiers (`models` in the
// same sealed text). The id of a tier's model is operator data that a workspace must never read, and the runner's
// result may repeat it (the model it reports, a log line); the operator can change a tier at any time, so the model
// the job really got is kept to mask it in the result, whichever app instance serves the completion. An app instance
// of the previous release reads `keys` and ignores `models`.
//
// The value is never logged and never leaves this module except as the lists `keysOf` and `modelsOf` return to the
// code that masks a result. A row that cannot be read (another `APP_SECRET`, a changed row) is skipped: masking is best
// effort, and the shape of a credential is still masked (`redact.ts`).

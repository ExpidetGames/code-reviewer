// The rule that a managed Dynamic run (and, since #754, a managed turn of the Implementer, which runs the same native way) never settles with an unknown cost (#553; epic #489: "the managed key is never used
// with an unknown price"). On the managed key we pay, so the price is known before the job starts (the claim carries the
// confirmed book) and the runner ends the run with `dynamic_accounting_failed` when a call's cost cannot be read. A result
// that still claims a success with a null cost is not trusted: it is stored as that failure, which billing treats as our fault
// (free), instead of a success the customer would be charged minutes for while nobody can say what it cost us. A result that
// reports no usage at all is left as it is: that is how an older runner and a usage that was dropped as malformed arrive, and
// it settles with an unknown cost as it always did. Pure.

// The part of the claim that chooses what a job runs on (#432, docs/decisions/0005-providers-model-catalog-and-paddle-
// billing.md, 2.8): it builds the input of `resolveModelSelection` from what the claim knows (the effective entitlements,
// the options of the project for the job's pinned kind, the providers of the caller), reads the catalog for a job on the
// operator's key, runs the resolver and turns a failure into the refusal the job ends with. It loads no key: the key
// follows the selection (`ClaimDeps.keyFor`).
//
// The managed input is built from the whole entitlements object, so what the billing epic adds to it (the `source` of the
// entitlements, #442) reaches the resolver through the same input and needs no second read path. The same goes for any
// other fact about the workspace that decides a managed job: it is added here, to one input, not read elsewhere.
//
// Nothing here logs a model or a key. A failure names a code, a reason, the kind and (managed) the opaque id of the entry.

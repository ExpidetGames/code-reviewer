// POST /api/runners/v1/jobs/:id/release: a Dispatcher gives a claimed job back because it could not
// start the Worker (#322). It proves the dispatcher credential in `Authorization` (checked by the
// caller) and the claim with the per-job credential in the body: the hash of the credential is the lease
// token the queue fences on, so another job's credential, an earlier claim's and a made-up one all
// fail the same way. The job goes back through the queue's `release`: one attempt is counted (a failed
// launch has no budget of its own), the job waits again from `retryAfterSeconds`, or fails with the
// reason on the last allowed attempt. The reasons are `launch_failed` (the Worker did not start) and
// `worker_exited` (#375: it started and its container ended with an error before it reported a result); a job that
// already has its result, or that another claim holds, is refused by the same fence and nothing changes.

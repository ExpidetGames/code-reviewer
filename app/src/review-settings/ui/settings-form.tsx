// The review settings form, for the global defaults and for one project (#174, #656). One form, one save, four
// sections as tabs: Review (the kind, the verdict and the review options), LLM (a provider and a model dropdown), Trigger
// (when the reviewer starts) and Limits (what one review may cost). The values in force are shown, every field says where
// its value comes from and can be taken back to the layer below with "Reset to default". A save replaces the whole set of the
// layer and is the only action in the footer; resetting the whole project to the defaults is a separate action in its own
// card at the bottom. Problems are checked before sending (the same validation the server runs, which checks again), shown as
// sentences at their field, and the first marked field gets the focus (its section is opened first); the estimated cost
// updates while the person types and warns above the limit without blocking anything.

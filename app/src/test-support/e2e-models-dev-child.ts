// A program the Playwright journeys run (node runs this file directly, TypeScript types are stripped;

// fetch does: through the real fetch service (parse, address check, plan, guard, one transaction) on the app's SQLite file, with
// the committed fixture of `fakes/fixtures/models-dev/` as the body and the names resolved to a public address, so nothing
// leaves the machine and no row is written by hand. The app is a separate process with the same file open (WAL), so the
// providers and models show up in its pages.

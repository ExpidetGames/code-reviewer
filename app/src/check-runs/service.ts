// The check run and the review verdict of a review job (#405, README.md in this folder). The App, not the Worker,
// makes GitHub match the job: it holds the installation token and sees every way a job ends (a result, a release, a
// supersede, a lease that ran out, the sweep). `syncJob` reads the job and does whatever is still missing, so it is
// safe to call from any of those places and to repeat:
//
//  - the check run of the job (one per job and head commit, named "Code Reviewer") shows the status of the job:
//    waiting, reviewing, and a conclusion that is never red (check-text.ts). It is made once and changed in place
//    by its stored id; one that was made but whose id was not kept (the process died) is found again by the id of
//    the job (`external_id`) before another is made.
//  - after a successful review the verdict is submitted once (verdict.ts), by the stored review id and, after an
//    attempt that may have worked, by looking for the App's own review with the job's marker first. It is submitted
//    only while the pull request is open and still at the head that was reviewed.
//
// Best effort throughout. Nothing here throws or changes a job: a failure is one log line with a stable code and ids
// only (never a token, a body or a name). A call that failed because GitHub could not be reached is tried again twice
// at once (after one and after three seconds), then the job waits and is tried again by `reconcileDue` (called by the
// sweep, the timer of a long-lived server and the requests that touch the database), at most five times; but while a
// check run is open on GitHub (made, not yet completed) the job is tried again for about fifteen hours, a wait of up
// to an hour between two tries, so no check stays "Reviewing" because of an outage. A sync lives within the time of
// the function that runs it (`budgetMs`) and is counted as an attempt when it starts, so one that is cut off is not
// forgotten. An App that was not granted the Checks permission (an installation that has not accepted it, an App
// made by hand) simply has no check run: the row's check part is dropped with `CHECK_RUN_PERMISSION_MISSING`, once
// per job, and the verdict, which needs another permission, goes on. A check run that was made and can no longer be
// written (the permission was taken away) is tried again like an outage. What stays open for good, because GitHub
// cannot be asked any more: an installation that is gone, a repository that was archived or left the installation,
// and a connection a person disconnected (README.md, "Failure behaviour").

// The admission of a claimed job (#277): inside the transaction of the queue's claim, after a job was taken and
// before its usage record is reserved, it resolves the entitlements of the job's workspace and decides whether
// the job may run (`decideAdmission`, src/usage/enforce-entitlements.ts). INSTANCE LEVEL like the claim it
// belongs to: it serves whichever workspace the oldest due job is in, and every statement it makes goes through
// repositories created for that workspace.
//
// Exactness: the claim runs under the exclusive gate lock of the queue, so two claims never read the count at once.
// The workspace row is locked as well (`for no key update`, which an insert that only references the row does not wait on), so the count stays
// exact if the gate is ever narrowed. A workspace without limits reads no usage and takes no lock.

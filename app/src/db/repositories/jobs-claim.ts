// The claim of a job: the one place in the job queue that is written for a dialect.
//
// SQLite (`claimOldestDueJob`): one `UPDATE ... WHERE id = (SELECT ... LIMIT 1) RETURNING *`, which
// SQLite runs as one atomic statement. Together with the `begin immediate` transactions of
// `dialect.ts`, which take the database's single write lock up front, two runners claiming at once
// are serialized: the second one sees the first one's row as `running` and takes the next job (or
// none).
//
// Postgres (`claimOldestDueJobPostgres`): the same statement with `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` in the
// sub-select, so two runners do not wait on each other's candidate. `SKIP LOCKED` alone is not
// enough: two queued jobs of one pull request have no running job to skip on, so both runners can
// pick one each. The partial unique index `jobs_one_running_per_pull_request_unique` (on both
// databases) is what keeps the rule; the second `UPDATE` then fails with a unique violation, which
// this code treats as "skip this job, try the next". A savepoint makes that recoverable: a Postgres
// transaction that hit an error cannot run another statement until it is rolled back to a savepoint.
// (An earlier version of this comment claimed `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` was the only line a port
// would change; it is not, and the index is the reason.)

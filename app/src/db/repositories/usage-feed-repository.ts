// workspaces from one token and reads what they all consumed, so there is no single workspace to scope to, and
// every item names its own. It only reads, never a `reserved` or `void` record, and nothing it returns is written
// back. The reads of ONE workspace (its page, its summary) are those of the scoped usage-records-repository.ts.

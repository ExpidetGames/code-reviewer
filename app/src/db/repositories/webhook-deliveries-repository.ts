// Access to the webhook_deliveries table: the record of which deliveries were accepted, so that a
// redelivery of a delivery that already succeeded does not produce a second trigger. The only code
// that reads or writes the table.
//
// GitHub's "Redeliver" sends the same `X-GitHub-Delivery` id again, so the id is also how a manual
// retry reaches the app. That decides the rules:
//
// - `claim` inserts the row with the outcome "processing" and returns a token that proves ownership.
//   Only the owner can `complete` or `release` the claim, so a request that stalled past its lease
//   cannot overwrite the claim of the request that took over.
// - Only the outcomes in `WEBHOOK_DELIVERY_FINAL_OUTCOMES` (a trigger was handed over, an
//   installation was synchronized) make the id a duplicate. Every other outcome is recorded for
//   diagnostics, but the id can be claimed again: a delivery that was turned away for a reason that
//   can change (the installation was not known yet, write access is granted later) is repaired by
//   redelivering it.
// - A request that arrives while another one holds a fresh claim gets "in_progress", not
//   "duplicate": the first one may still fail and release, and GitHub must then see a failed
//   delivery it can redeliver.
// - A claim that is neither completed nor released (the request died) can be taken over once its
//   lease ran out.
// - Rows older than 7 days are pruned, at most every 10 minutes per process.

// The deletion of ONE workspace (#658; the factory takes the workspace id, see ../workspace-scope.ts). It is the only
// code that removes a workspace's data as a whole, and every statement filters by that workspace, directly or through
// the repositories and jobs that belong to it. The caller (src/workspaces/delete-workspace.ts) runs it inside one
// transaction, with the repositories created on that transaction, after it has taken the locks, locked the workspace and
// checked the balance; nothing here decides whether a deletion is allowed except the facts it can read (`hasRunningJobs`,
// `hasOpenPayment`). `lockActiveJobs` is the lock that makes `hasRunningJobs` true to the end of the transaction.
//
// What goes and what stays (the reasons are in src/workspaces/README.md, "Deleting a workspace"):
// - goes: the members, invitations, connections (the GitHub installation is released), repositories, projects, jobs with
//   everything that hangs off a job (queue entries, comments, check runs, dispatches, claimed keys, VM runs, usage
//   records, refusal notices), the settings, the stored keys, the entitlements, the hand-over tokens, the link requests,
//   the billing limit and notification state, and the billing profile's personal fields (legal name, address, VAT id);
// - stays: the `workspaces` row itself, anonymised and marked with `deleted_at`, the billing journal (append-only, the
//   database refuses a delete, and it carries what accountants need: amounts, minutes, provider references), the
//   cached balances and the top-up intents that explain the credit, the start credit memory (it must keep a deleted
//   workspace from earning the credit twice) and the payment provider's customer reference (`customer_ref` on an emptied
//   billing profile row), which a refund or a dispute of an earlier payment may still need. The provider is the merchant of
//   record and keeps the invoices.

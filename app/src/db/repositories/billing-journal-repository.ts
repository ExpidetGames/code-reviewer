// The balance journal of ONE workspace (tables `billing_journal_entries` and `billing_balances`; the factory takes the
// workspace id, see ../workspace-scope.ts; ADR 0006, 2.7; src/billing/README.md). One USD balance per workspace, in
// micro-USD integers, as the sum of an append-only journal; the balance row is a cache updated in the transaction of
// every entry, and `verify()` compares the two.
//
// Everything that writes runs in one transaction (the caller's, when it hands in a transaction, so a later issue can put
// a reservation into the claim transaction) and is idempotent on the key `(workspace, type, ref_key)`: the same key with
// the same amount returns the entry that exists, with another amount it is `idempotency_conflict`. A `reserve` is the one
// conditional write, a hold of at most the balance: it takes the balance row's lock first (SQLite's `begin immediate`
// already serializes writers; Postgres `FOR UPDATE`), answers a repeated job from the entry it wrote, and runs
// `UPDATE ... SET balance = balance - :hold WHERE balance >= :hold`, so two claims of one workspace can never spend the
// same money. `reserveUpTo` is the same write for a claim: a job with a reservation gets it back unchanged, otherwise the
// hold is `min(wanted, balance)`. `settle` and `release` take the same lock before they read what a job has, so a
// settlement and a release of one job are decided one after the other and a voided job is never charged. Every other
// entry updates the balance unconditionally: a settlement, a refund, a chargeback or a correction may take it below
// zero: a balance of exactly zero refuses a `reserveUpTo` with `balance_exhausted`, one below zero with `balance_negative`
// (and every `reserve`). Every writer takes the balance row's lock before it writes anything, `append` included, so no two
// of them can wait for each other; `release` and `usage` are written only by `release()` and `settle()`.
//
// Entries are listed by `seq`, the order they were written in; `created_at` is a millisecond and not unique.
//
// Amounts are `bigint` columns: Postgres hands them back as text, so every one is converted with `Number` (exact up to
// 2^53 micro-USD, far beyond any balance). A row of another workspace is simply not there: a reversal names an entry of
// this workspace or it is `reversed_entry_not_found`, and a settlement names a reservation of this workspace.

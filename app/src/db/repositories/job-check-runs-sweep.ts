/**
 * Jobs that need a sync, oldest first, at most `limit`, from two reads that each use their own index:
 * - a job with an `active` row whose lease or back-off is over and that is behind: the check run (unless it was
 *   dropped) shows another status than the job has now (a lease that ran out, a timeout, a give-up or a switch-off
 *   ended it without a request of its own), or the job succeeded and its verdict is not decided yet; the retry of a
 *   sync that failed is one of these, so a hosted deployment whose sweep runs every two hours still reaches it;
 * - a waiting or running job that has no row yet (its first sync never started or never finished).
 * A job that ended before it had a row (for example before this feature) is not listed: nothing was ever shown.
 * The two are merged one from each in turn, so neither starves the other when there is a backlog.

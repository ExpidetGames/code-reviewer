// The minimal map from what a job selected to the models.dev catalog (#553; the mapping #549 left to the claim and #555).
//
// A selection names a provider by a **slug** of the app's registry (`^[a-z][a-z0-9_]{1,31}$`: the name of the secret that
// holds the key per provider) and a model by its id. The catalog names the same model by the **provider id** of models.dev
// (`^[a-z0-9][a-z0-9_-]{0,63}$`, with hyphens) and the model id. The map is the one rule that makes the two spellings one:
// the underscore of a slug is the hyphen of the id. It is one-to-one only for ids without an underscore, so an id that has
// one has no slug (and a model of such a provider cannot be selected), as does an id that starts with a digit.
//
// Which selection takes the native path (the passthrough proxy, the price check, the cost policy of #553) is decided here
// and nowhere else: a supported provider of `contracts/opencode-providers.v1.json` that is **not** a provider of the legacy
// registry. The two providers of the registry are in both lists; their wires stay the production path until #556 removes
// them, so a selection that names either is never native and nothing about its claim changes. The registry itself does not accept
// a native slug in a selection yet: that, and the key per native provider, belong to the wiring and #555 (README.md).

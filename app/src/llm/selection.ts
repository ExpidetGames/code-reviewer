// Which provider, model and catalog entry a job runs on, and whose key it will need (docs/decisions/0005-providers-
// model-catalog-and-paddle-billing.md, 2.8, steps 1 to 4). It runs before any key is loaded: the key follows the
// selection, not the other way round. Pure: no database, no clock, no environment, no network. Everything it needs is
// passed in, and nothing it is passed is changed.
//
// The input is a union on the key mode, like `ResolveLlmInput` (resolve.ts), so a branch has no place for the other
// branch's data:
//
//   - `own`: the provider and model of the job's kind, from the layers of the settings (workspace default, project) over
//     the built-in model. There is no catalog, no entry and no `modelAccess` here; an own job reads none of them.
//   - `managed`: the entry the project selected, else the instance default entry of the kind, else nothing. The entry must
//     exist, be released, serve the kind, be allowed by the plan and have a provider the app and the runner can use.
//     There is no fallback to another entry, another provider or the instance's model (decision C5): the first thing that
//     is wrong ends the job. The settings of the own mode are not an input.
//   - `unreadable`: the entitlements cannot be read, so it is not known whose key applies. Fails closed.
//
// The job's kind is an input, never the project's current kind: a job claimed for a Diff review stays a Diff review
// when the project switches to Dynamic meanwhile.
//
// A failure is a stable code and a reason, never a model. A managed failure names the entry's opaque id at most; the
// provider and the model of an entry are operator data that a member must not read.
//
// The caller (the claim, #432) maps a failure to the job's error and loads the key the selection names. This function
// does not decide that a workspace holds no key for the provider (`llm_not_configured`, reason `no_key`, decision C7): it
// has not looked.

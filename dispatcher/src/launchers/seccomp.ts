// An optional rule for the Worker container (#325): deny the `socket` call for chosen address
// families through a seccomp profile derived from Docker's default one. It is off unless a launcher
// is given the derived profile (`RenderOptions.seccompProfile`); the spike (#317) found AF_VSOCK
// already denied by a platform filter and by Docker's default profile, so this is defence in depth
// that a deployment can switch on, not a requirement.
//
// The rule does not add a deny entry beside the default allow of `socket`: two rules for one call
// would leave the outcome to the order the daemon applies them in. It takes `socket` out of the
// default allow list and allows it again only for every family but the denied ones, which is one
// rule with a single meaning. Not yet exercised against a real daemon (follow-up in the PR).

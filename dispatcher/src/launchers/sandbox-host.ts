// Where `docker run` executes for the Sandbox-Launcher (#329): inside one fresh Sandbox VM. It is a
// `ContainerHost` (container.ts), so the flags come from the one hardened container spec; what it adds is the
// life of the VM around that command:
//
//   prepare()  vm-prepare.sh as root (the cgroup fix, then dockerd, spike #317 F1), then the image check
//   run()      `docker run --interactive ...` as a process with a stdin pipe; the start document is written to
//              the pipe and the pipe closed. Nothing else carries it: not an argument, not the environment,
//              not a file on the VM.
//   handover   settles once the Worker has taken over (see `handover` below)
//
// A pending launch that is aborted kills the container by name; stopping the VM is the launcher's job. Nothing
// watches the container after the hand-over (#487): the wait that tells the hand-over from an early end is ended
// then, and the VM is stopped by the App's signal (`POST /stop`), with the reaper and the VM timeout behind it.

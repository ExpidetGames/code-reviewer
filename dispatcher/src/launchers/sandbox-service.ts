// The port between the Sandbox-Launcher (#329) and the Sandbox platform: the few things a job's VM needs.
// The Launcher never imports the platform SDK; `vercel-sandbox.ts` adapts the SDK to this port and
// `fakes/sandbox/` holds the doubles of it (an in-process one and a local one that runs Docker on this host).
// This is the per-job port. The golden snapshot pipeline (#330) has its own, wider one for builder VMs.
//
// Commands are argument vectors, never shell text: nothing here is parsed by a shell, so a value cannot
// become a command. The per-job credential is not part of any request except the stdin of the Worker process.

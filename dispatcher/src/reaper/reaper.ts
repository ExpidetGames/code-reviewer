// The reaper (#364): stops the Sandbox VMs of ours that outlived their purpose. The App's signed stop
// (`POST /stop`, #487) ends a job's VM when the job ends, and the Launcher stops the VM of a launch that failed before the
// hand-over; when neither happens (a stop that never arrived or failed, a restart, an App of a previous release) the VM
// is billed until its own timeout. This is the second line, run by the cron route (route.ts). It decides per VM, in this order:
//
//   - not one of ours (vm-shape.ts), or not running: not touched
//   - younger than two minutes: not touched (a launch in progress, a listing that lags)
//   - older than its maximum lifetime: stopped, whatever the App says (its own timeout, or the configured one, plus a
//     grace period: by then the platform's own timeout has failed to end it)
//   - a canary (no job): kept, only its lifetime ends it
//   - a job VM: stopped when the App says its job is not `running`; kept when it is, kept while the job is draining (a
//     superseded run whose Worker is finishing its requests and reporting, #397), and kept when the App's answer
//     cannot be read (fail safe: only the lifetime stops it then)
//
// Stopping is by the listed name; a failed stop is counted and retried by the next run. Nothing here logs a credential
// or the platform's own error text.

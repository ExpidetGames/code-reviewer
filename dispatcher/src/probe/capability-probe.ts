// The canary probe of a Dispatcher instance (#331, #479): it runs the Worker image's `probe` mode somewhere that has
// the real hardening (a canary VM, see launchers/sandbox-canary.ts) and reports what it found. It serves `POST /probe`,
// the deploy canary, and nothing else: **dispatch and claim never run it and never wait for it** (#479). The proof that
// a deployment may run Dynamic jobs is the canary that passed before the deployment went live; the snapshot pair and
// the settings cannot change during its lifetime. Fail closed, in every direction:
//
//   - the container says no, or says something that is not a verdict, or the probe cannot run, or it takes too
//     long: the report says so with a stable reason or code, never the text of anything
//   - one probe at a time per instance: any number of callers share the one that is running
//   - a forced probe is served from the last answer when it is younger than `forceReuseMs`, so a holder of the
//     credential cannot run canary VMs back to back
//
// Platform-free: the run itself is a function the caller brings.

The app supersedes a running job only when the claim named it. A Worker names it in the `features` of its details request. `dynamic_cost_policy` (#553): the runner reads `dynamic.cost` and enforces it (the price book of the managed key as the only price source, the token cap of an own key). A job that carries a cost policy goes only to a caller that named it; the app ends the job with `dynamic_engine_unavailable` otherwise, since a runner that did not read the policy would run without its bound. `vm_lifecycle` (#498): the caller is a Dispatcher that reports the VM it creates to the app (POST /api/runners/v1/jobs/{id}/vm, `KnownAppFeature` of the same name) so the app can measure billable minutes; the app records that it has seen a Dispatcher with and without it, and refuses to switch billing on while a Dispatcher without it has claimed recently. `cost_limit` (#666): the runner reads `llm.maxCostUsd` and enforces it next to the operator's own limit. The app sends it only to a caller that named it; a caller without it gets the job without the field and runs with the operator's own limit alone (a refused review is worse than a project limit that is not kept while a release rolls out), and the app logs that. A Worker names it in the `features` of its details request. `operator_cost_limit` (#689): the runner reads `llm.operatorMaxCostUsd`, the most one review may cost as the operator set it in the admin portal, and holds a review to the smaller of that and `llm.maxCostUsd`; it no longer reads `RUNNER_DYNAMIC_MAX_COST_USD` for a job that carries the field.
